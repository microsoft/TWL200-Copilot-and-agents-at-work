# Task 01: Create and configure the agent

## Introduction

Creating the base agent establishes the foundation for Zava's HR candidate-management solution. This agent will provide a conversational interface that helps the HR team quickly search, add, and update candidate records-reducing administrative delays and supporting the organization's goal to accelerate hiring cycles.

## Description

This step focuses on configuring the agent's core identity, purpose, and behavior. You'll define how the agent should interact with users, set descriptive context, and add suggested prompts that streamline common HR workflows such as listing candidates, searching records, and adding new applicants.

## Success criteria

- A new agent named HR Candidate Management is created.
- The agent includes instructions aligned to HR candidate-management workflows.


## Key tasks

1. In a browser window, select **Agents** from the left menu of the Microsoft Copilot Studio.

> Suggested prompts act as "one-click scenarios" for HR users. They surface the most common actions-list, search, add-without requiring users to guess the right phrasing.
