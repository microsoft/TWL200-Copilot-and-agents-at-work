# Exercise 01: Enable real-time ADO reporting with Agent Builder

## Case study overview

Zava Retail Group is a retail company with both brick-and-mortar stores and a growing e-commerce presence. 
Zava is focused on modernizing its operations through AI-driven solutions. The company recently launched an internal AI Center of Excellence (COE) to explore how agentic solutions can streamline workflows, improve decision-making, and enhance customer and employee experiences. 


The Executive office of Zava wants an easy way to get updated on key project status without having to sort through ADO tickets or reach out to high-priority project owners.  
In this exercise, you'll create an agent in Agent Builder that connects to the customer's Azure DevOps (ADO) instance and gives them an easy and fast way to find Zava retail projects with a high-priority status.
Adele Vance, a member of Zava's AI Center of Excellence, is responsible for configuring and piloting this project-status agent on behalf of the Executive Office.

## Objectives

After you complete this exercise, you'll be able to:
1.	Identify how to configure a connector for Agent Builder in Microsoft 365.
2.	Identify when Agent Builder is a solution for customer needs.
3.	Build an agent in Agent Builder.
