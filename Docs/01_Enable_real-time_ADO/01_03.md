# Task 03: Test the agent

## Introduction

In this task, you'll validate that the agent can successfully retrieve project data and summarize it for executive consumption. By comparing the agent's responses against Azure DevOps results, you'll ensure that the agent is grounded in the correct data source and ready for use by the stakeholders.

## Description

In this task, you'll run the configured prompts inside the agent to test its ability to query Azure DevOps work items. You'll then verify accuracy by reviewing the corresponding Azure DevOps queries and confirming that the returned results align with the agent's output.

## Success criteria

- The agent successfully retrieves data from Azure DevOps.
- Results from Agent Builder match the Azure DevOps validation queries.
